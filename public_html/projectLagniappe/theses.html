                <h1>List of Theses</h1>
                <p>These are my starting points, and this page will evolve as the project does. I foresee having to update content and moderate opinions as I gain knowledge, but I'm planning to maintain an accesible history.</p>

                <li>Progressive ideas are reasonable, solid approaches to solving a lot of huge problems.</li>

                    <blockquote>
                        First, I must confess that over the past few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to "order" than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: "I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action"; who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a "more convenient season." Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection.

                I am an American patriot who believes in justice for all people, especially the people who live within our borders or spheres of control. Come at me.</li>
                <li>Single issue voting is intellectual laziness and moral cowardice.<br />
                I'm thinking about the dEaD BaBiEs idiots, of course, but I think I can support the general case and draw specific examples from things on both sides of the cultural divide. The whole topic of guns is probably rich, maybe in both directions.

                You are not an environmental terrorist for drinking cheap coffee. You are not destroying the planet by not separating your recycleables. Every programmer, project manager, engineer, and building contractor on the planet knows that systemic problems are best, most cheaply, and most effectively solved at the front end of the process. You're not to blame for poor management and planning.
