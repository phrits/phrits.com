                <h1>Lagniappe</h1>
                <p>When I had a traveling job several years ago, I had occasion to spend a week installing software and training its users on the product in Lafayette, Lousiana. Someone had brought in doughnuts for the office one morning. There were a couple of dozen-sized boxes, and a smaller package with two or three extras that had not been requested, paid for, or expected. "Lagniappe" (LAHN-yahp), explained the administrative assistant, "just a little something extra".</p>
                <p>We've all heard of a "baker's dozen", with a thirteenth roll or buttermilk biscuit thrown in "for good measure" (c.f., <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+6:38">Luke 6:38</a>). That overfull portion is certainly a goodness, rooted in justice and fairness; i.e., the idea that a customer should not receive less than what they paid for. The measure lines on some European drinkware serve the same purpose. "Some settling may occur during shipping" is a plea that you not jump to the conclusion you have been shorted. Fairness is a really good place to start.</p>
                <p>Lagniappe is more than that. Better than that. Lagniappe includes the message "I'm not ripping you off", but it goes further. It's pure, human warmth, and it says "share from my bounty" or "this was too good to keep to myself" or "y'all come back soon". It implies "I made extra, because I hoped you'd stop by" or sometimes a whisper of "you didn't ask for it, but that child at your side looks hungrier than I'd like, and wouldn't his smile be grand!" Sure, it's good business, but the world sees our actions, not our intents.</p>
                <p>Kindness is a lovely idea, and everyone wants to be kind. Rah rah rah. And really, most folks are pretty good at the easy stuff: Holding the door for the next person, or maybe even speeding up so you can get that door for the person with their arms full ahead of you. Passing the ketchup bottle over to the next table, in the pre-COVID days, before that became an act of accidental aggression. Letting the person with only one item step in front of you and your full buggy at the store. Those actions are all more than fair, and they are kind.</p>
                <p>Waiters, delivery people, and lots of other folks depend on tips for most of their income. Responsible, adult members of US society tip well, because we understand that the person providing your service doesn't write the rules. Pre-COVID, somewhere around 20% was about the expected average tip most places, and if you're using these services during the pandemic, 25% should be your absolute floor. I tip well, usually north of 30% these days. That's just. I also tip well for "bad service". That's closer to kindness.</p>
                <p>I was seated with Honey Bunny on a sunny restaurant patio a few years ago, where we were greeted by our waiter, then promptly forgotten. We were perhaps a little underdressed&mdash;clothing cost more than style, I suspect&mdash;which I might not have even picked up on had the waiter been a little more professional with his facial expressions. We waited probably 20 minutes. Then I picked up my phone, called the restaurant, and requested that he stop by again at his earliest convenience. Dick move, right? But what I actually did there was give the hostess a small weapon&mdash;FOH is always a war zone&mdash;without getting the waiter chewed out by management. And I tipped well. I expect his next scruffy couple was treated better and had a better time.</p>
                <p>Good service or bad, though, I throw in an extra, single dollar bill, carefully folded into the shape of a man's collared shirt and necktie. Lagniappe. An extra kindness.</p>
                <p>It's only a dollar, and each one takes just a few minutes of my time. But I'm to the point now that I horde crisp singles for folding, and I really don't like to go out for service if I don't have one in my wallet. I like to tuck it away someplace where the server won't notice it until after I leave. I like being thanked when I'm caught, of course, but I like even better the surprise and delight that spills throughout the waitstaff when I'm not. I've seen it happen enough times to know that it usually does, and the result is positively festive&mdash;fireworks and Bollywood dancing!&mdash;when I have only my imagination to watch it. Kindness begets joy.</p>
                <p>I've gone back to places where I've left those dollar shirts, and sometimes they're displayed on the wall or behind a bar. Shared kindness. There was once a barbecue place that had two of them, framed on the counter by the cash register. It was the sort of hometown eatery where paying your tab was part of the visit, catching up with folks, making conversation, and hey! what's that in the frame, well let me tell you about that. Kindness begets joy.</p>
                <p>My regular servers have come to expect that little extra, of course, and they're maybe nicer to me than they'd be to a stranger or a known poor tipper. But that doesn't diminish the kindness invoked. The woman who cuts my hair passes them on to her niece. For all I know, the girl unfolds them and spends the money on candy: Kindess begets joy. Thirty years from now, my hair stylist won't remember anything about me except my ridiculous mustache and the little folded dollar shirts. But once in a while, she'll remember the guy with the dollar shirts and it will make her smile. And she'll think about when her niece her was little, and she'll smile again. You know the rest: Kindness begets joy.</p>

                <p>That folded dollar has become a sort of totem to me. It's a frequent reminder to myself that kindness is a virtue I want to cultivate. I've become pretty good at folding them, and the act is meditative. When I put aside a new dollar bill or scramble for one before go I out, when I make the conscious effort to press the fold just like that, when I tuck it behind my debit card where the creases will get sharper, these are human acts, for the purpose of giving another person, perhaps a stranger, a moment of joy. The person providing my service expects me to be polite, pay my bill, tip. A normal exchange that just gets lost into routine. But that bit of langniappe can brighten their whole day.</p>
                <p>Lagniappe is the essence of kindness. Kindness assumes justice, and improves upon it. The fight for social justice in the United States is pointing us in the right direction, but we can do even better. We owe ourselves better. We can brighten our whole future. The US has the means and ways&mdash;the wealth and the logistical capability&mdash;to provide not just subsistence, but comfort. Not just health or general welfare, but nourished growth toward a more perfect union. Not just fairness, but additional tools and resources to encourage a robust pursuit of happiness.</p>
                <p>We live right now in a horribly unjust world, and the genesis of the words you are now reading is anger. I am angry&mdash;incessantly, frothing-at-the-mouth, driving-away-friends furious!&mdash;at what has become of my country. The hunger and homelessness and sickness and neglect. The American Dream that you have to be born into to enjoy. How we are so devastatingly misled and cripplingly divided. The oppressive, ongoing suppression of creativity and entrepreneurship, yearning to breathe free.</p>
                <p>We must have justice! But we deserve, and can achieve even more. Society and politics run on negotiation, and you always have to ask for more than you strictly need&mdash;at the very least, at this moment, a fair playing field&mdash;so that there is room for compromise and balance. Those of us who are fighting for justice should strive for, demand, and fight&mdash;fight like hell!&mdash;for more than just enough. The worst that happens is that we overshoot our most dire need, everyone is a little better off than they strictly need to be, and there is more joy in the world. The best that happens is we stumble into world peace.</p>

                <h2>Author's Commentary</h2>
                <p>Just couple of notes, so I can get it out of my head for now and move on.</p>
                <p>I'm missing a connection in there. How, precisely, does individual kindness relate to getting societal wealth better spread out to its people? I can see it, but it's not well-demonstrated.</p>
                <p>And what's going on with that waiter on the patio? I think it's a true-life fable maybe? There's a lot happening, I guess: Could the author really not have found a better way? How is that phone call not just petulance rationalized post hoc? And it's hard to see how arming someone can be construed as a kind act itself, so the author is not without fault. I don't know if the anecdote will stay.</p>
                <p>My anger doesn't come through sincerely, either. That might be better served under separate cover. I hadn't really intended this particular article to turn into a manifesto, so I may need to remove the wrong turn. Keep going or wrap it up as makes sense from there.</p>
