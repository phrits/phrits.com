<h2 class="recipe">Old Fashioned Bread</h2>
<hr/>
<p class="author">Chi-Kali, Arizona</p>
<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 pkg. of yeast, 7 grams</li>
<li>2 T. of sugar</li>
<li>2 c. of lukewarm water</li>
<li>7 c flour</li>
<li>2 T. of melted butter</li>
<li>dash of salt</li>
</ul>
<p class="directions">In a mixing bowl, add the yeast and sugar, and the water. Mix well, then add half of the flour and the butter. Beat thoroughly, then gradually add the rest of the flour. You want the dough to be stiff, so you might not need all the flour, or you might have to add a little more. Knead dough for 5 minutes.</p>
<p class="directions">Put the dough into a bowl, cover it with a towel, and put it in a warm spot for about 2 hours. It should double in size. Then, knead the dough again for 5 minutes.</p>
<p class="directions">Let stand for 2 minutes, then shape it into 2 loaves and place in 2 greased bread pans. Again, cover them with a towel, put them in a warm place and wait 1 hour.</p>
<p class="directions">After the dough has risen the second time, put them in a pre-heated 375&deg; oven and bake for 1 hour. Let the bread cool before removing from the pans. Makes 2 loaves.</p>
