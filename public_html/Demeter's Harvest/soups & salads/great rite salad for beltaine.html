<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 1 lbs (16 oz) Pkgs Spiral/Corkscrew Pasta</li>
<li>1 1 lbs Basket Cherry Tomatoes</li>
<li>2 1 lbs Bunches Fresh Asparagus Spears</li>
<li>2 8 oz bottles Annies Naturals Goddess Dressing</li>
<li>1 sm. bunch fresh italian flat leaf parsley, cilantro, basil or any other favorite spring herb</li>
<li>1/2 c. chopped walnuts</li>
<li>1/2 c. crumbled Feta cheese or Blue cheese (optional, omit for vegan)</li>
<li>1 c. chopped, cooked chicken breast meat (optional, omit for vegan)</li>
<li>salt &amp; pepper to taste</li>
</ul>
<p class="directions">Cook the pasta according to package directions, except cook it a little more al dente than recommended. Drain the pasta into a large mixing bowl and allow to cool completely. You can refridgerate it to speed up the process, but make sure you coat it lightly with olive oil to keep it from sticking together. Meanwhile, slice all of the cherry tomatoes in half and set aside. Now peel the stalks of one bunch of the asparagus spears, set aside. With the other bunch of asparagus, cut the stalks off just below the tips to make 3-4 inch spear tips. In a a wide, shallow pan, bring about 4 cups of water to a rolling boil, add a few dashes of salt. Add all the asparagus and blanch for 30 seconds, or until crisp-tender. Drain and gently pat dry with a paper towel. When the pasta has completely cooled, add the tomatoes, small asparagus tips, walnuts and cheese then toss. Chop or cut the herb(s) gently until you have about 2 small handfuls of chopped herb then add to the bowl and toss. Add the dressing, reserving 1/4 cup, and add chicken if using, then toss. Transfer salad into a serving bowl and arrange the long asparagus spears across the top of the salad in whatever decorative manner you wish (I like to line them up into a pentagram). Chill for one hour. Yummy with a big honkin' piece of sourdough bread! :)</p>
<p class="note">This salad got it's name from the cherry tomato halves combined with the  asparagus spears and the cork screw pasta. Very symbolic indeed!</p>
