<h2 class="recipe">Triple Goddess Barley Goop</h2>
<hr/>
<p class="author">Sarah Glenn</p>
<p class="note">(Irreverent title: Snatch Soup)</p>
<p class="note">Suitable for honoring Kore/Persephone, Demeter, and Hecate. The parsley is sacred to Persephone, the barley to Demeter, and the garlic to Hecate. The pennyroyal is sacred to both Kore/Persephone and Demeter (the Two Goddesses of Eleusis), but <strong>should not</strong> be used if anyone in the circle is pregnant. It is also an acquired taste, in my opinion.</p>
<p class="note">This recipe is designed for folks who can't cook, like me. If you can cook, you can probably customize this to vegetarian needs or to suit your palate. </p>
<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 cans concentrated beef consommé or French Onion soup, <strong>plus</strong> recommended amount of water (4 cans non-concentrated beef broth will also work)</li>
<li>2/3 cup processed (including 'quick') barley (amount can be adjusted to thickness desired)</li>
<li>2 pinches dried parsley (or fresh sprigs as garnish)</li>
<li>Dash garlic powder (or to taste)</li>
<li>2 teaspoons grated Parmesan (optional, but makes it more tasty)</li>
</ul>
<p class="directions">***** If you are truly devout and <strong>not pregnant</strong>, a tiny pinch of pennyroyal can also be added. The taste is strong and more than a tiny pinch is not necessary.</p>
<p class="directions">Heat soup. Throw in dried parsley and barley and stir periodically until cooked. Garnish with Parmesan cheese and fresh sprigs of parsley.</p>
