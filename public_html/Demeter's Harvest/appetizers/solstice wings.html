<h2 class="recipe">Solstice Wings</h2>
<hr/>
<p class="author">Druean of Dragon's Grove</p>
<ul class="ingredients">
<li>5 lbs. chicken wings, sectioned. Drumette and middle section are used. Tips can be frozen and used for stock.</li>
<li>Salt to taste</li>
<li>1 stick of real butter, salted</li>
<li>1 4 oz. bottle of Louisiana or Frank's hot pepper sauce (the red stuff)</li>
<li>Ranch dressing</li>
<li>Blue cheese dressing</li>
</ul>
<p class="directions">Salt wings and put them in a zip lock bag in the fridge to marinate in the salt. Grill the wings until done, making sure that you turn them often and the skins get crispy. If a grill is not available, wings may be baked in a hot oven until done &ndash;425&deg;F for about an hour. Wings can be done ahead and heated up in the sauce later if need be. Melt butter in a stew pot, add hot sauce &ndash;all of it &ndash;and the wings. Let them sizzle a bit. If the wings were done ahead, make sure you give them time to heat up inside as well as out.</p>
<p class="directions">Turn out onto a big platter and serve with dipping sauces.</p>
<p class="note">Every year we think up variations on hot and spicy foods to serve at Alban Heruin &ndash;the Summer Solstice. This is a variation on a popular restaurant food, but is easily prepared outdoors on a grill or even open fire.</p>
