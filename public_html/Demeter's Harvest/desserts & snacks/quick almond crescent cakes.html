<h2 class="recipe">Quick Almond Crescent Cakes</h2>
<hr/>
<p class="author">Janet Schmidt, Illinois</p>
<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 pkg. refrigerated sugar cookie dough</li>
<li>1 c. ground almonds (pulverize them in the food processor, but stop before you get almond butter)</li>
</ul>
<p class="directions">Preheat oven to 350&deg;F. Place dough on a floured counter top. Flatten a bit and sprinkle the almonds on the dough. Fold the dough over and gently/lightly work the almonds into the dough. Take pieces of dough and shape into little "snakes" about as big as your index finger in length and diameter. Curve them to shape into crescents. Place on baking sheet sprayed with no stick spray and bake at 350&deg;F for 8&ndash;10 minutes until just lightly browned. Cool slightly and then take a plastic bag and put a cup or so of powdered sugar in it. Add a few cakes at a time to the bag and shake to coat in powdered sugar. Makes 18&ndash;24 cookies/cakes.</p>
