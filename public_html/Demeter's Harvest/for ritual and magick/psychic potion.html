<h2 class="recipe">Psychic Potion</h2>
<hr/>
<p class="author">Christopher Penczak, New Hampshire</p>
<ul class="ingredients">
<li>3 c. of Spring Water</li>
<li>4 T. of Sea Salt</li>
<li>1 tsp. Vervain</li>
<li>1 tsp. Rose buds</li>
<li>1 tsp. Star anise</li>
<li>1 tsp. Cinnamon</li>
<li>1 tsp. Thyme</li>
<li>1 tsp. Bay Leaf</li>
<li>1 tsp. Lemon Balm</li>
<li>1 piece of Silver jewelry</li>
<li>1 Moonstone crystal</li>
</ul>
<p class="directions">This is a formula for a water based potion used to increase psychic abilities. DO NOT CONSUME ORALLY. To use it, dab a few drops on your wrists, back of the neck, brow or other chakra points. The potion will help you safely expand your intuition and psychic abilities. Great to use before doing a reading or working magick.</p>
<p class="directions">Create a sacred space through ritual. Use any ritual that you are familiar with, such as a Witch's or Magicians Circle. Or simply light a candle and ask for the space to be sacred. Heat the water in a flameproof container. I use a pot pourri simmering dish, but you can use an enamel or glass container. Don't use iron or steel, since it's properties are too grounding for this magick.</p>
<p class="directions">Bless the Sea Salt and dissolve it in the water, stirring nine times. Add each of the herbs, one by one, asking them for help in developing psychic ability. Hold them in your hands and feel their energy before you put them in the water. Stir each herb nine times.</p>
<p class="directions">After you have added all the herbs, add a piece of silver jewelry that has been energetically cleansed and blessed into the potion. You can cleanse it by smudging it with sage smoke or soaking it in clear water for an hour. Silver is the metal of the Moon, opening psychic abilities and intuition. Also place a cleansed and blessed moonstone into the potion. When you strain and bottle the potion, you can take out the jewelry and stone.</p>
<p class="note">Christopher is an active teacher of witchcraft and healing in the New England area. He is the author of the book City Magick: Urban Rituals, Spells and Shamanism and can be reached at torcboy@aol.com.</p>
