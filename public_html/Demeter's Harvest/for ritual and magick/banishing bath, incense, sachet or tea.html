<h2 class="recipe">Banishing Bath, Incense, Sachet And/Or Tea</h2>
<hr/>
<p class="author">Everything Akasha, New Jersey</p>
<ul class="ingredients">
<li>Basil (5 fresh/dried leaves or 1/4 teaspoon ground)</li>
<li>Mint (5 fresh/dried leaves or 1/4 teaspoon ground)</li>
<li>Cumin seeds (1/4 teaspoon&mdash;use to taste if using ground cumin, as less is sometimes needed)</li>
<li>Cinnamon (3 sticks broken in 5, or 1/4 teaspoon ground)</li>
<li>Clove (5 pieces&mdash;if using ground, use an 1/8 tsp. or less)</li>
</ul>
<p class="directions">The number of herbs used (5) draws upon Mars energy. (Note: Fresh herbs do not work well in incense.)</p>
<p class="directions">These ingredients can also be used as a base for cooking a banishing meal, Here the number of herbs used is increased to 9, including the olive oil (for culinary purposes, as well as magickal, thus reflecting Hecate` energies). This is an herbal base which can be used along with a variety of stir-fry vegetables, chicken, or pre-cooked potato wedges. (Increase ingredients as needed to accommodate any more than 3 cups of the additional ingredients.)</p>
<p class="directions">Add:</p>
<ul class="ingredients">
<li>Garlic&mdash;3 cloves, finely chopped</li>
<li>1 medium Onion&mdash;cut into wedges</li>
<li>1 medium Italian Green Pepper&mdash;cut into half inch wedges</li>
</ul>
<p class="directions">Place one to two tablespoons of olive oil in the bottom of a warm pan. Take about an eighth to quarter teaspoon of each dried herb (dependent upon your personal taste), along with the garlic. Be sure flame is low enough to ensure that herbs do not burn and blacken, but high enough to form bubbles around garlic when it is dropped into heated oil. Simmer for about 45 seconds to 1 minute.</p>
<p class="directions">Drop onion and pepper into mixture. Stir and simmer until onion begins to clarify and pepper begins to soften, turning a bright green.</p>
<p class="directions">Add additional vegetables, chicken, pre-cooked potato wedges, etc. If mixture appears to be becoming too dry;, you may wish to add a bit of chicken broth, water, or even fruit juice, dependent upon what you are cooking.</p>
