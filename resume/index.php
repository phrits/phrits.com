					<h3 class="resume firstline"><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/profile/company/WFC:US">Wells Fargo</a><br />
						2000-04 to Present, more or less</h3>
					<p>
						I was hired by First Union in 2000 as a Senior Remedy Developer because the bank wanted to implement Remedy's Distributed Server Option for reporting, just at the dawn of data warehousing. I was well-known among ARSLIST participants for my expertise with the DSO product, and the job was as perfect a fit as I've ever had. I led the design, development, and deployment of a new corporate trouble ticketing system that included the new reporting server.
					</p>
					<p>
						The IT Help Desk used the ticketing system, with hundreds of concurrent users fielding well over 10k tickets per month. I wrote (in Object Oriented Perl) an automated system that took the Help Desk user's ticket and dispatched the third-party PC technician. The interface automated <span class="fixed">ftp</span> sessions to exchange data wrapped in a (way!) simplified version of XML I implemented for the purpose. The program ran error free for five years until it was decommissioned. And for one brief moment in time, I grokked the Perl regex in its fullness.
					</p>
					<p>
						I moved toward the business side of things after that. I wrote procedures and policies and checklists and all manner of documentation for the bank's "enterprise" Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) process. I learned formal approaches to workflow and business process modeling. I modeled present- and future-state processes. I reversed-engineered a modeling tool to create the data dictionary its documentation should have included.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Great Recession and Wells Fargo's purchase of Wachovia put me out of a job in late 2009. I was unemployed for a while, contracted a couple of times. When I found myself in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit_Jobs">dead-end, boring, meaningless, soul-sucking</a> contracting role, I <a href="/writing/leaving_it">changed careers</a> and went to wash dishes. I spent 2&half; years in the professional kitchen. Most of that time was in same Wells Fargo facility I'd worked at for the bank. The newspaper even <a href="https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/local/article9090509.html">told my story</a>!
					</p>
					<p>
						I came back as a contractor in 2015, a junior role to the one I'd left. Boredom. Tedium. A few insights as to why the bank has been in the news forever. Then suddenly fun stuff! Out of nowhere, I'm in a challenging and fun role with management that may turn out to be some of the best I've ever had. I'm currently working on a major software migration project supporting Cash Vault Operations. It's challenging, exiting, and has high visibility.

					<h3 class="resume firstline"><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/profile/company/NRTLQ:US">Nortel</a><br />
						1998-05 to 2000-04</h3>
					<p>
						My family and I had decided to move from Greenville,&nbsp;SC to Raleigh,&nbsp;NC to be closer to other family. I started at Nortel as a contractor (Senior Remedy Developer) but eventually became a fulltime employee. I worked at the company's Raleigh Technical Education Center, in the pre-Y2K days of the Baby Bells running the phone systems. Nortel was building a service that helped the various telecommunication companies track their circuit outages, etc.
					</p>
					<p>
						 We implemented a Remedy DSO "follow-the-sun" system that transferred tickets from one system to the next, even though there were substantial differences in each locale's implementations. Swisscom, for example, worked their tickets their way during the day in Europe, but the Comm Center would keep the work going, tracking things according to our processes, then passing them back resolved or still WIP as called for.
					</p>
					<p>
						I gathered requirements, then designed, built, and tested the system. I installed and supported the operating system on the server (HPUX 10 or 11). I installed and supported the database (Sybase 11). And the Remedy software. Etc. One-person everything, 24/7/365. None of my work caused an unplanned outage.
