                        Since moving back to Goldsboro in April, 2022, I have met hundreds of incredible and creative peole. How could I help but get involved? As I write this, I have the honor of serving on the Boards of Directors and in various committees for the <a href="https://dgdc.org/" alt="DGDC link">Downtown Goldsboro Development Corporation (DGDC)</a> and the <a href="https://artsinwayne.org/" alt="ACWC link">Arts Council of Wayne County (ACWC)</a>, and as the Chairman of the city's <a href="https://www.goldsboronc.gov/mayor-of-goldsboro/boards-and-commissions-resume/" alt="Link to Goldboro Boards and Commissions">Historic District Commission</a>. I love this city more every day!

						I have worked in just about every corner of automated business workflow&mdash;business side or tech. I've done everything from coding and database administration to business workflow development and implementation. And all of the requirements, design, documentation, reports, and lifecycle maintenace that comes with the territory.

						I've been an adventerous home cook forever: Meat and potatoes, sure, but also ice cream, candied peppers, beer, bacon, and bugs! I've read everything from Rombauer to McGee. I even <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1522xl/after_a_reasonably_successful_25year_career_in_it/" alt="My Reddit AMA">dropped out of the IT workforce, took a job as a dishwasher</a>, and <a href="https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/local/article9090509.html" alt="Charlotte Observer Article">cooked professionally</a> for a couple of years!</p>

						Links to assorted interests, some old writing. More to come eventually&mdash;in the past several months, I've been in a <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm15492190/">movie</a>, acted in a play, and made my stand-up comedy debut&mdash;but I'm planning to do some site work before I catch up and publish here more frequently.
