<h2 class="recipe">Great Relief Oil</h2>
<hr/>
<p class="note">for Aromatherapy and Magickal Use</p>
<p class="author">Brianna Gloriana Skylark, Ohio</p>
<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 oz. base oil (your choice &mdash;olive, sweet almond, jojoba &mdash;don't use a polyunsaturated oil!)</li>
<li>1 oz. dropper bottle or other 1 oz. bottle</li>
<li>18-36 drops cypress essential oil (to preferred strength)</li>
<li>18 drops lavender essential oil</li>
<li>18 drops rosemary essential oil</li>
</ul>
<p class="directions">Add approximately half of the base oil to the bottle. Add each oil in turn, visualizing its energy entering and combining with the base oil and other oils. Roll the bottle between your hands to mix. When all oils are added, top off with remaining base oil (not too much!). Mix. When all ingredients are combined, charge for use according to your own methods. Use to relieve grief by putting a few drops on a tissue and inhaling, anoint people, candles, etc. This will not take away grief, but it will make it more bearable. Notable for relieving symptoms of chest tightness (heart chakra pain) associated with grief. Can be used magickally as well to help someone in mourning. Do not ingest.</p>
