<h2 class="recipe">Angie's Soup</h2>
<hr/>
<p class="author">Angie</p>
<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 1/2 lbs. potatoes, peeled and cubed.</li>
<li>Tomato Sauce 4 large cans (or one of the really huge cans)</li>
<li>Tomato Paste 1 large can</li>
<li>Frozen vegetables 1 bag each of corn, mixed veggies, whatever you like.</li>
<li>1 lb. ground beef browned ground up while cooking it. Seasoned to taste as  well.</li>
</ul>
<p class="directions">To start peel and cube potatoes first. Put in large soup pan with water to  cover potatoes. Set burner at medium heat. Cover. Brown meat, drain and add  to the potatoes. Add veggies, Tomato sauce and paste. Season to taste. Let  cook for at least 3 hours. Stir it every once in a while so it won't stick to  the bottom of the pan. Serve with corn bread or whatever you wish. Not sure  how many it serves I think around 10. Can be frozen and reheated.</p>
