<h2 class="recipe">Green Soup</h2>
<hr/>
<p class="note">an old Norse recipe</p>
<p class="author">Judy Nesmith/Siobhan, Texas</p>
<ul class="ingredients">
<li>3-1/2 to 5 oz of fresh spinach or 8 oz of frozen whole spinach</li>
<li>4 in (10 cm) of the white part of a leek</li>
<li>1 qt. bouillon (chicken or beef)</li>
<li>1/2 c. chopped parsley</li>
<li>Dash of salt</li>
<li>Dash of pepper</li>
<li>Dash of ground ginger</li>
<li>2 - 3 egg yolks</li>
<li>1/2 c. cream</li>
<li>Grated nutmeg</li>
</ul>
<p class="directions">Clean, rinse, and parboil fresh spinach or thaw frozen. Rinse leek and slice thinly. Bring bouillon to a boil and add spinach and leek. Boil 5 minutes. Add parsley and boil a few more minutes. Season with salt, pepper, and ginger.</p>
<p class="directions">Whisk yolks with the cream in the bottom of your serving dish. Pour in soup while whisking briskly. Grate nutmeg over the soup and serve it with a good bread.If you don't trust the hot soup to make the eggs safe use Egg Beaters instead, which are pasteurized. Unfortunately they also have the egg white too. Eggs from the shell would probably be fine if you planned to serve immediately.</p>
<p class="note">This recipe was served at an SCA Yule revel by Lady Sunnifa Eiríksdóttir and was posted to the list later for the benefit and use of the populace.</p>
