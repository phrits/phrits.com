<hr/>
<p class="author">Rayne Dancer</p>
<ul class="ingredients">
<li>3/4 c. Vegetable Shortening</li>
<li>1 c. Sugar</li>
<li>1/4 c. Light Molasses</li>
<li>1 lg. Egg</li>
<li>2 1/2 c. Flour</li>
<li>2 tsp. Baking Soda</li>
<li>1/4 tsp. Grated Nutmeg</li>
<li>1/2 tsp. Ground Ginger</li>
<li>1 tsp. Ground Cinnamon</li>
<li>1/2 tsp. Salt</li>
<li>Sugar or Icing for garnish</li>
</ul>
<p class="directions">Melt the shortening in a saucepan over low heat. Add the sugar and the molasses. Lightly beat the egg and add it to the mixture, stirring well. Transfer to a large bowl. In a small bowl, mix the flour, baking soda, and spices, stirring until well blended. Add to the molasses mixture, mixing well. Chill for 1 to 2 hours. Preheat the oven to 350&deg;F. Roll the dough in lightly floured waxed paper, adding flour to the dough and roller as needed. Roll the dough into a thickness of about 1/4 inch. Lightly grease 3 baking sheets. Cut the cookies with cookie cutters, dipping the cutters in flour each time you cut a cookie. Place the cookies on the baking sheets. Sprinkle the cookies lightly with sugar(unless you will be decorating them with icing). Bake the cookies for 8 to 10 Minutes, Watch them carefully to make sure the gremlins or pixies don't cause them to burn! Remove the cookies from the baking sheets and transfer them onto wire racks. Let cool for 5 minutes.</p>

<p class="note">If you like, embellish the cookies with icing or frosting, which will please the faeries, who love any treat that is sweet and creamy.</p>
