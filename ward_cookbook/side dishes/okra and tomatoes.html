<h2 class="recipe">Okra And Tomatoes</h2>
<hr/>
<p class="author">Druean of Dragon's Grove</p>
<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 1 lb. bag of frozen okra</li>
<li>1 15 oz. can of tomatoes</li>
<li>1 lb. of bacon</li>
<li>1 sm.l yellow onion</li>
<li>1 sm. bell pepper green or 1/2 of a large one</li>
<li>salt and pepper</li>
</ul>
<p class="directions">Cut bacon into four section and fry all at once. Make sure you let it get very crispy. Remove to drain. Dice the onions and the peppers. Retain enough fat in the pan to saute the onions and peppers. When the onions start to soften, add the frozen okra and the can of tomatoes with the liquid. Salt and fresh cracked pepper to taste. Tomatoes can be diced or whole, just make sure they end up in bite size pieces. Reduce the heat so that the mixture simmers and cover. Cook at least 30 minutes, longer if need be to get the okra good and done. Serve hot with bacon crumbled on top. Adjust seasonings before serving. If mixture is too dry, add some tomato sauce. Also, can be served over rice. When I was a kid, my grandmother would pick the garden and make this for lunch. Today, I don't have a garden, so in the winter, I raid the grocery store freezer section.</p>
