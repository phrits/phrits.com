<p class="author">Darla Kaye Wynne, South Carolina</p>
<ul class="ingredients">
<li>3 Med. Potatoes</li>
<li>1 Med. Onion</li>
<li>1 Med. Jalepeno Pepper</li>
<li>1 Sm. Bell Pepper</li>
<li>1 Med. Sereno Pepper</li>
<li>1/2 tsp. Red Pepper</li>
<li>1/2 tsp. fresh garlic</li>
<li>1 T. Tabasco Sauce</li>
<li>1 med. Green Tomato</li>
<li>Salt</li>
<li>Pepper</li>
</ul>
<p class="directions">Slice your potatoes into 1/16th of an inch thick. Sprinkle your dried spices over them. Cut your onion into medium size pieces. Cut your bell pepper into bite size pieces. Cut your hot peppers into very small pieces. Cut the green tomato into bite size pieces. Mix all ingredients together.</p>
<p class="directions">?On your stove top, get a heavy frying pan, preferably cast iron, hot with 1/2 inch of cooking oil. When oil is about ready to bubble, add your potato mixture. Cover with lid, and reduce heat to medium high. In about 8 minutes turn the potato mixture over and cover with lid. Check your potatoes and cook until done, but make sure they don't stick to the bottom of the pan. Serve warm, with a garnish of a salsa of your choice or guacamole. Serves 2.</p>
<p class="note">This is pretty hot, so I would recommend sitting down with a nice glass of milk, which takes the heat from the food. You will be surprised to see that the food is rather hot, but the taste is not of the peppers and the heat is subtle, kind of sneaks up on ya!</p>
