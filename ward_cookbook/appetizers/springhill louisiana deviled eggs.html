<ul class="ingredients">
<li>Eggs</li>
<li>Mayonnaise</li>
<li>Mustard</li>
<li>1 tsp. sweet relish per 3 eggs</li>
<li>Cheddar or Mozzarella Cheese</li>
<li>Red Onion</li>
<li>Crispy Bacon</li>
<li>Tomato</li>
<li>Salt</li>
<li>Pepper</li>
<li>Garlic</li>
</ul>
<p class="directions">This recipe can be used to feed one person or a large crowd. The amount of everything depends on how many people you are feeding and the best results is to make it according to your taste. Boil eggs until done. Under cold water peel your eggs so the shell does not tear the egg. Set aside and dry. Cut eggs into halves and scoop out the yolk into a bowl. Take a fork and mash the yolks to insure that there are no lumps of yolk and it is nice and powdery.</p>
<p class="directions">Fry your bacon, and keep in mind the bacon should not control the flavor of the eggs, so if you are making just a couple of eggs, you might only want a single slice of bacon, if it is a crown, a whole pound of bacon. Make sure the bacon is nice and crispy. Drain on paper towel. Let cool. And crumble into a bowl. Remember from this point out, everything is done according to taste. Cut up the onion in real small pieces and set aside. Grate your cheese or feel free to blend your cheeses. Again remember, no specific ingredient should control the flavor of the eggs.</p>
<p class="directions">Start out with a tablespoon of mayonnaise adding this to your egg mixture. Add a little bit of mustard. You want your egg filling to be nice and creamy to start with. Add your crumbles bacon, cheese, and onion. If your mixture is starting to get a little dry at this point, don't worry, it is now time for your tomato. Do not slice the tomato, but cut a small hole in the end of it and squeeze the innards out of it. Mix well and taste. If it is still dry, add a little more mayo and mustard, not too much, it should be a thick substance and not runny. Add salt, pepper and garlic to taste. You can garnish with black or green olives cut in half and some even like to sprinkle a little paprika on the top to make it pretty.</p>
