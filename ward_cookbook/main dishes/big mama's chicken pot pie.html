<hr/>
<p class="author">Darla Kaye Wynne, South Carolina</p>
<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 1/2 lb. of boneless, skinless chicken breast</li>
<li>2 lg. potatoes, peeled and cut into small bite size pieces</li>
<li>3/4 lb of baby carrots</li>
<li>1 lg. White Onion</li>
<li>8 oz. of mushrooms</li>
<li>1 can of green sweet peas</li>
<li>2 T. of all purpose flour</li>
<li>salt to taste</li>
<li>pepper to taste</li>
<li>garlic to taste</li>
<li>water</li>
</ul>
<p class="subrecipe">Pie Crust</p>
<ul class="ingredients">
<li>3 1/2 c. of all purpose flour</li>
<li>2 sticks of Land O Lakes Butter, sliced and quartered</li>
<li>1/2 c. of crisco</li>
<li>1/2-1 c. of ice cold water</li>
<li>1 tsp. of salt</li>
</ul>
<p class="directions">In a large pot, add your chicken, potatoes, carrots, onion, mushrooms and just enough water to barely cover them. Boil until completely done. Remove the chicken and cut into bite size pieces. Add the sweet peas,salt, pepper and garlic. Sift the flour into the mixture. Stir with a wire whisk to insure it doesn't clump to make a smooth gravy. Add the chicken. Cook on low heat until thick, stirring often. Do not let scorch.</p>
<p class="directions">Serves 8-12.</p>
<p class="subrecipe">Pie Crust</p>
<p class="directions">In a bowl, sift flour. Add salt and stir with a spoon. Take a teaspoon and toss the crisco into the flour mixture, slightly tossing to cover the lumps of oil with the flour mixture. Take the quartered slices of butter and do the same as you did with the crisco. Make your flour mixture into a well kind of shape, with the flour forming a peak. Make sure your hands are clean, because they will begin to be your tools. I even recommend keeping a bowl of ice water with ice cubes close by, too cool your hands down when you are mixing these ingredients. Add a half of cup of the ice water to the well and begin to slightly and gently toss your flour mixture into the water. Continue to add water until the flour mixture begins to make a ball and is moist, but not real wet. Do not crush the butter and crisco up into the mixture. If your hands begin to melt the butter or crisco, cool them down before continuing to mix the mixture. Put in the freezer wrapped in saran wrap when the mixture has formed a ball that will not stick to your hands. Make sure you don't over handle your pie crust, it will make your crust elastic and hard to eat. You want your crust chilled before going on to roll it.</p>
<p class="directions">Take the chilled dough out of the freezer and put on a slightly floured surface. Take the palms of your hand and go down the edge, slightly squishing the butter and crisco into the mixture. Divide the mixture into 4 balls. Roll each ball into the flour mixture. Coat your rolling pin with flour. Easily, roll your dough into a circle until it fits your pie pan. Put the pie crust into the bottom of pie pan. Take a fork and poke holes all over the bottom. Fill the pie crust up, with the chicken pot pie mixture. Roll your next pie crust in the same manner. Lay it over the top of the pie. Pinch the edges together and then take a fork and pinch it closed. Take a knife and cut 3 slits into the top and center of the pie crust. Bake at 425&deg;F for 15-20 minutes. Reduce heat to 350&deg;F and cook for 45 minutes or until you can see the mixture boiling through the slits and the pie crust is slightly brown on top and edges. Serve warm.</p>
<p class="note">This is a nice dish to warm up on a cold wintery night.</p>
