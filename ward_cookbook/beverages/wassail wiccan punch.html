<p class="author">Rayne Dancer</p>
<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 C. Water</li>
<li>4 C. Sugar</li>
<li>1 T. Freshly Grated Nutmeg</li>
<li>2 T. Ground Ginger</li>
<li>6 Whole Cloves</li>
<li>6 Allspice Berries</li>
<li>2 Sticks Cinnamon</li>
<li>1 Dozen Large Eggs separated</li>
<li>4 Bottles Sherry or Madeira Wine (see Note)</li>
<li>2 C. Brandy</li>
<li>Baked Apples (recipe following)</li>
</ul>
<p class="subrecipe">Baked Apples</p>
<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 Dozen Delicious Apples or Your Favorite</li>
<li>1/2 C. Firmly Packed Brown Sugar</li>
<li>3/4 C. Margarine or Butter at room temperature</li>
<li>1 tsp. Grated Nutmeg</li>
<li>1 tsp. Ground Cinnamon</li>
</ul>
<p class="directions">In large saucepan, combine water, sugar and spices. Over medium-high heat, boil for 5 minutes. Beat the egg whites until they stand in soft peaks. In a separate bowl, Beat the egg yolks, using a large heatproof bowl. Quickly strain the sugar and spice mixture through a strainer, to remove large particles, into the eggs. In separate pans, bring the wine and the brandy almost to the boiling point. In increments, mix the hot wine with the spiced and egg mixture, beginning slowly and stirring briskly with each addition. Toward the end of this process, add the brandy. Add the baked apples just before serving and while the mixture is still foaming.</p>
<p class="note">NOTE: This can also be made with a combination of beer (a good dark beer is best) and wine, preferably sherry, with roughly 4 parts beer and 1 part sherry. The beverage is served hot, so plan on a heat-proof punch bowl. This recipe makes enough for a crowd; just how large a crowd depends on your group's taste for rich, spicy wine drinks.</p>
<p class="directions">~~ 16 to 18 (1 Cup) Servings ~~</p>
<p class="subrecipe">Baked Apples</p>
<p class="directions">Preheat the oven to 375&deg;F. Peel the upper half of each apple. Core the apples to within 1/2 inch of the bottom. Place the apples in an ungreased baking dish. Place 1 scant tablespoon of the brown sugar, 1 teaspoon margarine, a pinch of the nutmeg, and a pinch of the cinnamon in the center of each apple. Sprinkle the remaining spices over the apple. Pour 1/4 inch of water into the baking dish. Bake for 30 to 40 minutes, basting occasionally. To test for doneness, pierce the apples with a fork; they should be tender.</p>
