[Comment, 2024-05-04. Good heavens, this is terrible! I'm adding a new section and having to update the menu file for 'bout every damn thing. I'm going to need to get on the Components version sooner than I thought. This is kind of embarassing.]

This is the repo for my personal website, [`phrits.com`](https://phrits.com).

## Status

The old site has been ported to [`old.phrits.com`](https://old.phrits.com/) and tagged with a banner indicating that it is no longer maintained.

2022-12-27: New start. Let's find a job.

## Branches

Anything starting with `zz_` in its name is dead. False starts, mistakes, probably some garbage. If I can find a way to archive just a branch, I'll do it eventually.
