# phrits.com

This is the repo for my personal website, [`phrits.com`](https://phrits.com).

## Status

The old site has been ported to [`old.phrits.com`](https://old.phrits.com/) and tagged with a banner indicating that it is no longer maintained.

The server side is now connected to GitHub and has a database awaiting. I'm not yet going to worry about virtual vs. production environments for Django, etc. there.

The client side development environment (my PC) is ready with Django, Flask, etc. under Anaconda. Local PostgreSQL.

Next up: A "while you wait" landing page.

## Branches

Anything starting with `zz_` in its name is dead. False starts, mistakes, probably some garbage. If I can find a way to archive just a branch, I'll do it eventually.
