# phrits.com

This is the repo for my personal website, [`phrits.com`](https://phrits.com).

## Status

I'm in the early stages of getting a Django project set up. I intend to port the existing content, make the site easy to maintain, and give it a more modern look and feel.

## Branches

Anything starting with `zz_` in its name is dead. False starts, mistakes, probably some garbage. If I can find a way to archive just a branch, I'll do it eventually.
