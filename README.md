Checkpoint: http://localhost:800 shows the Django welcome screen.

- Create a View.

```
# .../app/views.py
from django.shortcuts import render
from django.http import HttpResponse

# Create your views here.
def index(request):
    return HttpResponse("Hello, world!")
```

- Create a URL pattern. 'views.py' has to be updated in app folder and its parent.

```
# .../app/views.py
# May need to be created or copied from parent folder.
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.index, name="index"),
]
```
