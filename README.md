# phrits.com

## UI

-   It has to look right. In particular, it has to be readable:
    - Desktop, Tablet, Phone
    - Watch?
    - Even when the CSS file can't be found
    - Even when JavaScript is disabled
    - Agnostic across all browsers

-   It should print a useful document.

-   It would be swell if:
    - Selectable themes
    - The printout version isn't overly cluttered, even with missing CSS
    - Links are automatically tested and handled appropriately
        - Bonus points for making it automatic and letting me know when something goes newly stale.
    - Live archive; i.e., phrits.com as it looked on a particular date

## Functionality
