									<p>The caption&mdash;<span class="foreign">Mise en place</span>&mdash;was a way to bring professionalism into my home kitchen. This picture is from an article the Charlotte Observer ran <a href="https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/local/article9090509.html" title="Starting Over" alt="archived article about Fritz">about me back in 2013</a>.</p>

									<p>My Abelian Grape is commuting out of the big city. The yellow sign is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_identity">Euler's Identity</a>: <img id="euler" src="/images/eulers_identity.jpg" />. The front plate once read "ARICOOLED", honoring my son's tattoo. The lettering was very fine, and Alex had told me it was unlikely to be legible.</p>
									<p>Yes, I sat under the tattoo needle for hours because I wanted a math pun indelibly marked on my skin. 10/10, would do again!
