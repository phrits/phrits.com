									<p>My first tattoo, one of several by Alex Jones at Old Crescent Tatoo in Concord, North Carolina. I've known Jonesy since he was a kid&dash;another of my many sons&mdash;and I was happy to provide canvas for his growth.</p>
									<p>The caption "<span class="foreign">Mise en place</span>", was a way to bring professionalism into my home kitchen.</p>

									<p>When Alex was about to receive his full license, he had to do some free work on people to demonstrate his competence. The grafitti style and colors are completely his, matching the style and approach for much of his art in other media.</p>

									<p>My Abelian grape is commuting out of the big city. The yellow sign is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_identity">Euler's Identity</a>: <img id="euler" src="/images/eulers_identity.jpg" />. The front plate once read "ARICOOLED", honoring my son's tattoo. The lettering was very fine, and Alex had told me it was unlikely to be legible.</p>
									<p>Yes, I sat under the tattoo needle for hours because I wanted a math pun indelibly marked on my skin. 10/10, would do again!

									<p>I need to get a pic of the tattoo.</p>
									<p>On my right arm is a tattoo featuring my maternal-maternal great-grandmother's cast iron skillet, a knife made by Honey Bunny's great-grandfather, my paternal grandmother's rolling pin, and my own salt pig. The caption "Food Is Love", was a way to bring the joy of home cooking into the professional kitchen.</p>
