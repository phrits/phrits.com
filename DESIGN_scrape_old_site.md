# DESIGN_scrape_old_site

## Goals

- Import existing phrits.com into database records

- via Models

- Create Models to hold those imports to use for

- Populating the new site

- scrape new content as successfully

## Meta

- This branch is intended to be merged wholesale. The models.py, etc. should be copyable, externally if not through GitHub magic.

- DRY. Maybe locate strategically then use throughout whatever comes along.

- tests.py
