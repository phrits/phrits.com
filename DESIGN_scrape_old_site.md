# DESIGN_scrape_old_site

## Goals

- Import existing phrits.com into tables

- Create tables to hold those imports to use for

- Populating the new site

## Meta

- This branch is intended to be merged wholesale. The models.py, etc. should be copyable, externally if not through GitHub magic.

- DRY. Maybe locate strategically then use throughout whatever comes along.
