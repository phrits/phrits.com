### Visual Notes

#### Comfortable Colors

Consider for the palate making the main, the dark blue brigher by 20% or so. Highlight yellow gets muted or morphed appropriately.

Consider dark mode backgrounds to make stuff jump when it should.

#### Neumorphism

Looks self-codable, but there appear to be some free wheels out there already. Generators such as [Neumorphism.io](https://neumorphic.design/) include concavity and inset for input parameters, then produce borders and shadows. Examples:

```
background: linear-gradient(145deg, #6677DB, #465397);
border-radius: 36%;
box-shadow: 7.21px 7.21px 9px #353E72, -7.21px -7.21px 9px #778CFF;
```

```
border-radius: 50px;
background: linear-gradient(145deg, #0000f5, #0000ce);
box-shadow:  25px 25px 35px #000073,
             -25px -25px 35px #0000ff;
```
