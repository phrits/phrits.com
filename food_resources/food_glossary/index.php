                            <p>Baking is a <a href="#dry_heat">dry heat</a> cooking method in which an item is placed in an enclosed, heated container such as an oven. Heat is transferred by <a href="#convection">convection</a> and <a href="#radiation">radiation</a>. Baking is really the same as <a href="#roast">roasting</a>, the difference in usage mostly referring to what's being cooked. Breads and other, well, bakery items, are typically &quot;baked&quot;, while a ham or prime rib of beef would instead be &quot;roasted&quot; Baked chicken? Sure. Baked Potatoes? Yup. Baked beef? Not technically wrong, but certainly not a common use of the word.</p>
                            <p>There's also a such thing as a steam oven, used in professional bakeries. They don't cook with enough <a href="#steam">steam</a> to be considered a <a href="#moist_heat">moist heat</a> cooking method, but the extra moisture in the air causes the <a href="#starch">starch</a> in the flour to <a href="#gelatanize">gelatanize</a>, and produces that wonderful crisp baguette crust. If you listen closely, you can hear a good crust crackling as it cools.</p>

                            <p>Sauce B&eacute;chamel is one of the <a href="#mother_sauce">mother sauces</a>.

                            <p>To partially cook something, usually to reduce later cooking time or to preserve an ingredient's color. Food can be blanched in <a href="#water">water</a>-based liquids as one might do with green beans to be <a href="/cooking_school/glossary/#saute">saut&eacute;ed</a> later. Food can also be blanched in <a href="#oil">oil</a> or deep <a href="#fat">fat</a>, such as one might do with a breaded <span class="foreign">chicken cordon bleu</span> for browning before finishing it in a hot oven just before <a href="#plate">plating</a>. See also <a href="#shock">shock</a>.</p>
                            <p>Since blanching can be done with either water or oil, it is typically considered to be neither a <a href="#dry_heat">dry heat</a> nor a <a href="moist_heat">moist heat</a> cooking method.</p>

                            <p>Boiling is a <a href="moist_heat">moist heat</a> cooking method in which food is submerged in <a href="#water">water</a> at its maximum liquid temperature, its <a href="#boiling_point">boiling point</a>. Boiling is characterized by rapid movement and agitation, so it is best suited for foods that benefit from the activity. Pasta boils well, but <a href="#stock">stocks</a> become cloudy, and biscuit-style dumplings completely fall apart. The term is often misapplied: &quot;Hard-boiled&quot; eggs, for example are more often <a href="#simmer">simmered</a>.</p>

                            <p>The temperature at which a liquid converts to a gas. For pure <a href="#water">water</a> at sea level, the temperature is 212&deg;F or 100&deg;C. At higher elevations, because of the naturally lower air pressure, liquids boil at lower temperatures. Adding ingredients will raise the temperature slightly. In neither case, however, are cooking times significantly affected. We salt pasta waster for flavor: The heat increase is tiny and the difference in time is well below what you'd measure.</p>
                            <p>The temperature of a pure boiling liquid is constant; i.e., pure water at sea level at a full boil is going to remain at a constant 100&deg;C. <a href="#steam">Steam</a> itself&mdash;the invisible stuff in the bubbles, not the stuff you see condensing in the air over the pot&mdash;can be much hotter. In physics or chemistry, you might also see the term &quot;condensation point&quot; which is interchangable with &quot;boiling point&quot;, but you'll probably never see the former used in a recipe.</p>

                            <p>Braising is a <a href="#moist_heat">moist heat</a> cooking method involving enough <a href="#water">water</a> to at least partially cover the food being cooked, long cooking times, and relatively low temperatures. It's sometimes described as a &quot;hybrid&quot; method because a food is often <a href="#brown">browned</a>&mdash;typically saut&eacute;ed&mdash;for extra <a href="#flavor">flavor</a> and color before putting it in the liquid for full cooking. While many foods are considered sufficiently cooked when they reach a particular internal temperature, braised foods are usually cooked until they reach the desired level of tenderness. The method is best applied to tough cuts of meat that have a high proportion of connective tissue, which turns into <a href="#collagen">collagen</a>. The classic American pot roast is a perfect example of a cut best braised.</p>

More often, though, the term refers to the browning of meat, the <a href="#maillard">Maillard reaction</a>. That browning is a complex interaction of the amino acids that make up <a href="#protein">proteins</a>, and <a href="#sugar">sugars</a>.

                            <p>Brown sauce is often reduced further into a demi-glace: Start with a quart of brown sauce, reduce it by half, add a quart of brown stock, and reduce it by half again.</p>
                            <p><a href="#small_sauce">Small sauces</a> include Sauce Robert, with butter, onion, white wine and mustard; Diable, with white wine, shallots, and peppercorns; and Piquante, with shallots, vinegar, wine, capers, pickles, parsley, and tarragon.</p>
                            <p>To be technically correct, there may be minor differences between &quot;brown sauce&quot; and its French term, &quot;espagnole&quot; Those differences, if they exist, may have to do with whether or how much tomato product is introduced to the mix. For our purposes at <a href="http://analytical-life.com/">Analytical-Life</a>, the two sauces are interchangeable.</p>

You can melt sugar and heat it until it starts to turn slighly brown. Add some cream to that and you have a simple caramel candy. Caramelization carried too far leaves nothing but black, bitter carbon, the hydrogen and oxygen having been driven off into the air.</p>

The &quot;magic&quot; in cooking something to perfection is a matter of knowing just exactly how much more something will cook, and allowing for it. In the case of the example roast, you might take it out of the oven at an internal temperature of 145&deg;F, knowing that it will probably reach about 150&deg;F, which might be closer to your particular medium-well preference.</p>

                            <p>Convection is a method by which heat in a fluid&mdash;liquid or gas&mdash; moves and disperses through the medium. In an oven, for example, the heating element causes the air very close to it to rise. That air is replaced by other nearby air, and is then itself heated. The result is that the air mixes and the heat distributes. It is convection in a pot of <a href="#simmer">simmering</a> or <a href="#boil">boiling</a> liquid that causes its temperature to be fairly uniform throughout.</p>
                            <p>&quot;Convection&quot; ovens make use of <a href="#mechanical_convection">forced</a> or <a href="#mechanical_convection">mechanical convection</a>, which, while similar, isn't quite the same thing. (Think of blow-drying long hair vs. just letting it air dry.) If it is important in a recipe to distinguish between the two types of oven, the one without the fan is often referred to as &quot;conventional&quot;.</p>

                            <p>Deep <a href="#fat">fat</a> frying (or simply "deep frying") is a <a href="#dry_heat">dry heat</a> cooking method in which food is submerged in hot, liquid fat, typically in the range of 325&deg;F/160&deg;C to 400&deg;F/200&deg;C depending on the cooking medium's <a href="#smoke_point">smoke point</a>. &quot;Liguid&quot; and &quot;dry&quot; may seem to be incompatible here, but they're not. <a href="#moist_heat">Moist heat</a>, by its very meaning, involves <strong>water</strong> or a water-based liquid.</p>
                            <p>Think about the most common deep fat fried food in America: The French fry. A properly cooked french fry is crisp on the outside, but soft and moist on the inside. The hot oil cooks by heating the potato's contained water well past its boiling point. The <a href="#starch">starch</a> on the inside <a href="#gelatanize">gelatanizes</a> in the hot <a href="#steam">steam</a>, and the outside <a href="#brown">browns</a> and crisps as it would in a hot (and efficient) enough oven. Another piece of that exact same potato cooked in water might be good for mashing or in a salad, but you couldn't politely pick it up with your fingers for dipping in ketchup.</p>

Egg yolks contain a substance called lecithin, which has a characteristic that's useful in the kitchen: Lecithin molecules are two-ended; one end mixes well with water, the other with oil.

                            <p>Fat is one of the most important ingredients in cooking. It carries and enhances flavor, it promotes even cooking, it adds texture and richness, and it contributes to a feeling of satiety, the sense of fullness and satisfaction one gets from eating.</p>
                            <p>Fat is necessary for life and it is present in nearly every food source from which we draw our ingredients. It's in whole grains, nuts, and seeds. Meat, eggs, and dairy. It occurs naturally in fruits, and in very high concetrations in some, such as avocados. And of course, it's the main or only ingredient in lard, butter, and shortening. When a fat is liquid at room temperature, it's usually referred to as an <a href="#oil">oil</a>.</p>

Using a lid is the only one of those approaches that <strong>might</strong> keep your dish edible. Watch what you're doing and beware of <a href="#smoke_point">smoking oil</a>. You can usually avoid having to choose between your home and your dinner. <strong>Do Not</strong> try to use water to put out a grease fire. It will only make matters worse.</p>

                            <p>The freezing point is the temperature at which a liquid converts to a solid. The melting point is the same exact temperature. Which one to use is only a matter of situational preference. Whether you're using ice water to cool something off or you have water turning to ice in the freezer, the transitional temperature is the same.</p>
                            <p>For pure <a href="#water">water</a>, the temperature is 32&deg;F or 0&deg;C. Adding ingredients will lower that temperature, perhaps significantly. Fruit juice, for example, has a lower freezing point than water, so it wil take longer to solidify in your freezer.</p>
                            <p>The temperature of a freezing liquid is constant; i.e., a well-mixed bowl of ice and water will remain at a constant 32&deg;F/0&deg;C until only the water remains. Salt is sometimes added to lower the temperature&mdash;think of a hand-cranked ice cream churn&mdash;but it may not help as much as folks might hope. You can also salt the ice and water used for <a href="#blanch">blanching</a> to help maintain the flavor. Most of the time, though, that's probably overkill: If you're leaving things in <a href="#shock">shocking</a> water that long, waterlogging is a more significant concern.</p>

The result is a more efficient cooking environment&mdash;more heat remains in contact with the food&mdash;so cooking temperatures or times are often reduced.</p>
                            <p>Mechanical convection is not suitable for some <a href="#bake">baking</a> or <a href="#roast">roasting</a> applications.

                            <p>There are five &quot;mother&quot; or &quot;leading&quot; sauces in modern French-influenced cooking. They are so named because they are the bases of so many others. The mother sauces are <a href="#veloute">Velout&eacute;</a>, <a href="#bechamel">B&eacute;chamel</a>, <a href="#espagnole">Espagnole</a> (Brown Sauce), <a href="#tomato">Tomato</a>, and <a href="#hollandaise">Hollandaise</a>. B&eacute;chamel is seldom served as is, for example, but you've eaten it in macaroni &amp; cheese if you've ever had the real thing. Velout&eacute; comes in at least three varieties and can as easily be the base for Cream of Broccoli Soup or Sauce Normandy with oyster juice, cream, and egg yolks.</p>
                            <p>Mnemonic: You can remember the mother sauces with the sentence &quot;Very Bad Eggs Taste Horrible.&quot; (Analytical-Life can't take credit for that: It's taught in the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&safe=off&client=firefox-a&hs=34v&rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&q=%2Bcpcc+%2Bculinary+awards&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&oq=&gs_rfai=" class="external" target="_blank" title="Google search +cpcc +culinary awards">top-knotch</a> culinary program at <a href="http://www.cpcc.edu/" class="external">Central Piedmont Community College</a>.)</p>
                            <p>Note that there are sauces that are not descended from these mothers. A simple flavored vinegar doesn't even require heating, for example. Soy Sauce's ancestors and Worcestershire Sauce both begin with the <a href="#ferment">fermentation</a> of anchovies, not <a href="#reduce">reduction</a> of <a href="#stock">stocks</a> or <a href="#emulsify">emulsification</a> of <a href="#fat">fats</a> and liquids.

Roux (plural, spelled and pronounced the same the same as the singular) are described by color from lightest to darkest: white, blonde, brown, and &quot;black&quot;, although if it gets <strong>that</strong> dark, it's going to be unpleasant and bitter. Beware the <a href="#carryover_cooking">carryover</a> effect.</p>
                            <p>To make a roux, whisk the fat and flour over medium high heat in a saut&eacute; pan. Mix fairly frequently while it bubbles and cooks. The roux will begin to smell like fresh bread, and at this stage it is considered white. Continue to cook and stir until it starts to smell toasty but hasn't begun to change color very much: Blonde. Cooked further to a golden brown or a little darker: Brown. And cooked until it's a deep, mahogany brown, you have a black or Cajun roux.</p>
                            <p>A pound of blonde or white roux&mdash;8 ounces each of fat and flour&mdash;will thicken a gallon of stock to a medium consistency. Darker roux won't thicken as well, so plan to use more of it for the same level of thickness.</p>

                            <p>It's also incredible easy to make from scratch. Start with a pound of <a href="#mirepoix">mirepoix</a>, maybe a little salt pork or bacon, and <a href="#sweat">sweat</a> or <a href="#caramelize">caramelize</a> it as you prefer. Add herbs and other flavors you like&mdash;a quarter pound of parmesan cheese (or a leftover rind or two), some fresh fennel or fennel seed, garlic, oregano, thyme, rosemary, maybe a little sugar or a splash of vodka. Add a #10 can&mdash;about a gallon&mdash; of tomato. Puree, crushed, chopped; any form works. <a href="#simmer">Simmer</a> for half an hour to 45 minutes, puree, and adjust seasonings. To that, you can add browned ground beef or sausage, slices of mushroom, or fresh basil as you like.</p>
                            <p>This is a big batch, so plan to store leftovers. It'll keep in the fridge for at least a week, and you can freze it for considerably longer than that.</p>

                            <p>It's also different. First it's made with a white stock&mdash;chicken or veal, or fish fumet. Second, the <a href="#mirepoix">mirepoix</a> is <a href="#sweat">sweated</a> rather than <a href="#caramelize">caramelized</a>.</p>

                            <p>Water, H<sub>2</sub>O, is essential to life, and common in the kitchen in its liquid state as well as in its solid (ice) and gaseous (<a href="#steam">steam</a>) forms.
