            <h1>Updated</h1>
            <p>Don't let it distract you from what follows, but I've slightly improved the <a href="/recipes/quickle/">base recipe</a> since this was first written. (Spoiler: Add some kale.)</p>

            <h1>Quickle Pickle</h1>
            <p>Simple: Cabbage, onion, cucumber, salt, vinegar. That's it. High flavor and essentially no fat or calories.</p>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li class="ingredient">1 head of cabbage</li>
                <li class="ingredient">1 red onion</li>
                <li class="ingredient">2 cucumbers</li>
                <li class="ingredient">2 Tbsp. salt</li>
                <li class="ingredient">2 Tbsp. red wine vinegar or to taste</li>
                <li class="ingredient">additional salt to taste</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Wash and core the cabbage, then slice it as thinly as you can.</li>
                <li>In a colander over a bowl or sink, mix the 2T of salt into the cabbage</li>
                <li>Peel and slice the onion as thinly as you can. A mandolin works well (but not with the cabbage). Mix the onion into the salted cabbage.</li>
                <li>Peel (or don't) the cucumbers. Cut them lengthwise, then gently scrape out the seeds and pith. Cut as thinly as you can. Mix in with the salted cabbage and onions.</li>
                <li>Place a small plate or something similar on top of the cabbage mixture and weigh it down. (A gallon jug of water or a big can works nicely.) Allow to sit for 45 minutes to an hour.</li>
                <li>Remove the plate and rinse the cabbage mix under running water.</li>
                <li>Transfer to a plastic zipper bag or a large mixing bowl.</li>
                <li>Add red wine vinegar and salt to taste.</li>
                <li>Serve or refrigerate for up to a few days.</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Note</h2>
            <p>The original name for this recipe was "Quick Pickled Cabbage", but one of my tongue-tied kids accidentally renamed it to something that doesn't scare off brassicaphobics quite as quickly. While <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/fls/fl122.html">recipes cannot be copyrighted</a>, I'm happy to give full credit to Mark Bittman for this one. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/How-Cook-Everything-Simple-Recipes/dp/0028610105"><span class="title"></span>How to Cook Everything</span></a> is worth your attention.</p>

                    <li class="ingredient">2 zucchini, thinly sliced or julienned</li>
                    <li class="ingredient">1 large onion, thinly sliced</li>
                    <li class="ingredient">3 or 4 cloves of garlic, sliced paper thin or minced</li>

                <p>You can also add some good quality extra virgin olive oil if you like, but the result will be more like a dressed salad. You'll lose that fun squeakiness that Quickle's crunch usually has.</p>

                <h2>Hot Quickle</h2>
                <p>This is a much smaller batch than the others because if you make it hot enough, most mere mortals will treat it as a condiment&mdash;try it instead of <span class="foreign">pico de gallo</span> sometime&mdash;rather than a side dish. You could use fewer hot peppers, of course, but where's the fun in that? For a light, easy, and highly flavorful lunch dish, serve Hot Quickle wrapped in a corn tortilla with avocado, fresh cilantro, and fresh lime.
                <p>Oh, and wear gloves when you're cutting the hot peppers or you'll hate yourself later.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="ingredient">1/4 small red cabbage, thinly sliced</li>
                    <li class="ingredient">1 small onion, thinly sliced</li>
                    <li class="ingredient">1 or 2 cloves of garlic, sliced paper thin or minced</li>
                    <li class="ingredient">2 or more fresh jalape&ntilde;o, serrano, habanero&mdash;careful!&mdash;and/or poblano peppers, thinly sliced</li>
                    <li class="ingredient">1/4 c. loosely packed fresh cilantro leaves, roughly chopped</li>
                    <li class="ingredient">1T salt for pickling</li>
                </ul>
                <p>After it's pickled and rinsed, add:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="ingredient">white vinegar and/or fresh lime juice to taste</li>
                    <li class="ingredient">salt and pepper to taste</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Other Notes</h2>
                <p>I love my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Harold-Import-Company-BN1-Mandoline/dp/B0000VZ57C/">mandolin</a>, but I've learned that not everything should be paper thin. About 1/8-inch (3mm) slices of onion mix better with the raw cabbage than thinner ones. The same goes for zucchini and the like. Slices of carrot or radish are firmer and less watery, though, and the thinner they are, the better. </p>
                <p>Incidentally, it turns out that it is possible to oversalt the pickle-in-progress, but the worst of that is that it's wasteful. If your quickle is too salty after rinsing but before you've added the vinegar, etc., you can soak it in a bowl of fresh water for a little while.</p>
                <p>With all the combinations I've tried, the original&mdash;just cabbage, cukes, and onion&mdash;is still close to my family's favorite. I've added some kale to my master recipe, though: The dark green color is striking against the paler cabbage, and the deeper slightly more bitter flavor adds a nice couterpoint to its slight sweetness. I also usually include some carrots julienned or sliced very, very thinly. The color just pops and the flavor goes well with all the rest of it.</p>
                <p>I haven't been completely pleased with some of my experiments: I found the oregano in the Italian Quickle to be a little distracting, for example, and the fresh grated ginger in the Asian Quickle brought a little more bitterness than I cared for. There's a lot to be said for personal taste, though, and your mileage may vary. Mix and match with things you like. Good stuff!</p>
