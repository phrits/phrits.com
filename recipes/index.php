				<div class="wrapper style3 recipe">
					<h2><a href="/recipes/crazy_cake/">Crazy Cake</a></h2>
						This is one of Mrs. <span class="phrits-invert">phrits</span>'s favorite go-to recipes. It's not terribly sweet, and it has an almost bread-like texture, so it's very versatile. You can slice and toast it. Or break it up and layer with whipped cream for a trifle. You can frost it, dust it with cinnamon and sugar, or drizzle with caramel sauce. Or serve it under fresh peaches and cream or cherry compote. [<span class="dietary">Vegetarian</span>, <span class="dietary">Vegan</span>]

				<div class="wrapper style3 recipe">
					<h2><a href="/recipes/barbecue_sauce/">Eastern North Carolina Barbecue Sauce</a></h2>

						The first cookbook I remember owning or reading, <span class="title">Betty Crocker's Cookbook for Boys and Girls</span> (1975) included a recipe for shirred eggs in bologna cups. I made it a few times when I was a kid. Decades later, when my wife and I blended our families, she introduced a tradition of having a big breakfast on Christmas morning. These have been a favorite part of that meal ever since.
